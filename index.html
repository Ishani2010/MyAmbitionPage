    <h2>Ishani</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Ishani. I am in Grade 6. I am a student at ProGrad Junior. My favourite colour is pink. My hobbies are to dance and code.

    <h2>My Ambition is to become a Software Developer</h2>
    <img src="./developer image.jpg" alt="">
    <p>I want to become a Software Developer because I have always been curious about new technologies. How the applications run and how the games are created. Now that I have started to learn about coding I find it interesting and very simple to do. I look forward to creating many applications and games.
